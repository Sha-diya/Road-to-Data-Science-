## Python Fundamentals and Problem-Solving

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises and solutions aimed at reinforcing fundamental programming concepts. The code examples are organized into several key areas for easy reference and learning.

### 1. **Sequence Sum Calculation:**
This section includes code to calculate the sum of a sequence of the form:
\[
\text{1/1! + 2/2! + 3/3! + \ldots + n/n!}
\]
By using loops and factorial functions, the sequence sum is calculated for a given integer `n`.

### 2. **Nested Loops:**
Nested loops are explored with various problems:
- **Unique Pairs within a Value of `n`:** Code to print unique pairs `(i, j)` where `i` and `j` are in the range of `n` and are not equal to each other.
- **Pattern Printing:** Several examples demonstrating how to print patterns using nested loops. These include:
  - **Asterisks (*) patterns** for visual designs.
  - **Numeric patterns** for structured output.

### 3. **Loop Control Statements:**
The usage of loop control statements is demonstrated with examples:
- **`break`**: To exit a loop prematurely.
- **`continue`**: To skip the current iteration and move to the next one.
- **`pass`**: To handle situations where no action is required (used as a placeholder).

### 4. **Finding Prime Numbers:**
This section includes code that finds and prints all prime numbers within a given range. It introduces concepts of divisibility and optimization for prime number calculation.

### 5. **Strings:**
Comprehensive coverage of string operations is provided, including:
- **Creation, Accessing, and Editing Strings**: Learn how to manipulate strings using indexing and slicing.
- **String Functions**:
  - **`capitalize()`, `title()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, `swapcase()`** to change the case of characters.
  - **`count()`, `find()`, `index()`** for searching within strings.
- **Advanced String Operations**:
  - **`split()`, `join()`, `strip()`** to handle string formatting and manipulation.
  - **String formatting** using **`format()`** method for customized output.

### 6. **Problem Solving:**
Several example problems are presented to practice basic algorithmic challenges:
- **Printing patterns** based on a given input.
- **Solving basic algorithmic challenges** with simple logic and loops.
