## Python Fundamentals and Problem-Solving

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises and solutions aimed at reinforcing fundamental programming concepts. The code examples are organized into several key areas for easy reference and learning.

### 1. **Sequence Sum Calculation:**
This section includes code to calculate the sum of a sequence of the form:
\[
\1/1! + 2/2! + 3/3! + ---- + n/n!}
\]
By using loops and factorial functions, the sequence sum is calculated for a given integer `n`.

### 2. **Nested Loops:**
Nested loops are explored with various problems:
- **Unique Pairs within a Value of `n`:** Code to print unique pairs `(i, j)` where `i` and `j` are in the range of `n` and are not equal to each other.
- **Pattern Printing:** Several examples demonstrating how to print patterns using nested loops. These include:
  - **Asterisks (*) patterns** for visual designs.
  - **Numeric patterns** for structured output.

### 3. **Loop Control Statements:**
The usage of loop control statements is demonstrated with examples:
- **`break`**: To exit a loop prematurely.
- **`continue`**: To skip the current iteration and move to the next one.
- **`pass`**: To handle situations where no action is required (used as a placeholder).

### 4. **Finding Prime Numbers:**
This section includes code that finds and prints all prime numbers within a given range. It introduces concepts of divisibility and optimization for prime number calculation.

### 5. **Strings:**
Comprehensive coverage of string operations is provided, including:
- **Creation, Accessing, and Editing Strings**: Learn how to manipulate strings using indexing and slicing.
- **String Functions**:
  - **`capitalize()`, `title()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, `swapcase()`** to change the case of characters.
  - **`count()`, `find()`, `index()`** for searching within strings.
- **Advanced String Operations**:
  - **`split()`, `join()`, `strip()`** to handle string formatting and manipulation.
  - **String formatting** using **`format()`** method for customized output.

### 6. **Problem Solving:**
This section presents various example problems and solutions to help practice basic algorithmic challenges and Python concepts. Here are some of the problems included:

- **Problem 1: Sequence Sum Calculation**
  - Calculate the sum of the sequence \(\{1/1! + 2/2! + 3/3! + ----- + n/n!}\) for a given integer `n`.

- **Problem 2: Nested Loops for Unique Pairs**
  - Print unique pairs `(i, j)` where `i != j` for `i` and `j` in the range `n`.

- **Problem 3: Pattern Printing**
  - Print various patterns such as asterisks (`*`) and numeric patterns using nested loops.

- **Problem 4: Loop Control Statements (Break, Continue, Pass)**
  - Demonstrate the use of the `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements in loops with practical examples.

- **Problem 5: Prime Numbers Finder**
  - Find and print all prime numbers within a given range.

- **Problem 6: String Operations**
  - Perform various string manipulations such as slicing, searching, and formatting using built-in Python string functions.

- **Problem 7: Symmetrical String Check**
  - Check if a given string is symmetrical (i.e., both halves of the string are identical).

- **Problem 8: Reverse Words in a String**
  - Reverse the order of words in a given string.

- **Problem 9: Uncommon Words from Two Strings**
  - Find and return the uncommon words between two given strings.

- **Problem 10: Word Location in a String**
  - Find the location (index) of a specific word in a sentence.

- **Problem 11: Remove Duplicate Characters from a String**
  - Remove all duplicate characters from a string while retaining the first occurrence of each character.

- **Problem 12: Append Second String in the Middle of First String**
  - Insert the second string into the middle of the first string at the appropriate position.

- **Problem 13: Sort Characters in a String**
  - Sort the characters of a string in ascending order.

- **Problem 14: Check if a String is Symmetrical**
  - Determine whether the string is symmetrical by checking if both halves of the string are equal.
