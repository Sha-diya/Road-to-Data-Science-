## Day 04: Lists in Python

### Introduction to Lists:
- Definition and characteristics of lists.
- Differences between lists and arrays.
- Memory storage of lists.

### Creating Lists:
- Examples of creating empty, one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and heterogeneous lists.
- Type conversion to create a list.

### Accessing and Editing Lists:
- Indexing and slicing to access list items.
- Methods to add items to a list (append, extend, insert).
- Editing items using indexing and slicing.

### Deleting Items from Lists:
- Methods to delete items (del, remove, pop, clear).

### Operations on Lists:
- Arithmetic operations (+ and *).
- Membership and loop operations.

### List Functions:
- Built-in functions (len, min, max, sorted, count, index, reverse, sort, copy).

### List Comprehension:
- Creating lists using list comprehension for various purposes (e.g., adding numbers, scalar multiplication, filtering).

### Traversing Lists:
- Two ways to traverse a list: item-wise and index-wise.

### Zip Function:
- Explanation of the zip function and an example program to add items of two lists index-wise using zip.

### Problems:
- Adding numbers 1 to 10 in a list using list comprehension.
- Scalar multiplication on a vector.
- Adding squares of numbers in a list.
- Printing all numbers divisible by 5 in the range 1 to 50.
- Finding languages that start with the letter 'p'.
- Nested if with list comprehension: Checking if fruits exist in a basket and start with 'a'.
- Printing a (3,3) matrix using nested list comprehension.
- Cartesian product using list comprehension on two lists.
- Writing a program to add items of two lists index-wise using zip.
